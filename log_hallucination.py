Thank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our Q4 financial performance. Consolidated revenue was $9.3 billion for the quarter, up 4% from a year ago. Gross margins were 74.3% of revenue in the quarter, in line with our expectations. Operating expenses were $1.2 billion, flat year-on-year. R&D of $940 million was also stable year-on-year.
Operating income for the quarter was $5.7 billion and was up 4% from a year ago, with operating margin at 62% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $6 billion or 65% of revenue, in line with expectations. This figure excludes $124 million of depreciation. Now a review of the P&L for our two segments, starting with our semiconductor segment.

Company Name: Broadcom | Quarter: Q4 | Hock E. Tan President and Chief Executive Officer at Broadcom Thank you, Ji, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. In our fiscal Q4 '23, consolidated net revenue was $9.3 billion, up 4% year-on-year and very much as we had guided at the last conference call. Semiconductor Solutions revenue increased 30% [Phonetic] year-on-year to $7.3 billion, and Infrastructure Software revenue grew 7% year-on-year to $2 billion. Overall, while Infrastructure Software remains very stable, semiconductor is continuing the cyclical slowdown at enterprises and telcos that we have been seeing over the past six months. However, hyperscalers remain strong. Generative AI revenue driven by Ethernet solutions and custom AI accelerators represented close to $1.5 billion in Q4 or 20% of semiconductor revenue, while the rest of the semiconductor revenue continued to be rather stable at

Infrastructure Software revenue was $7.6 billion, up 3% year-on-year. Gross margin for the year was 74.7%, down 90 basis points from a year ago. Operating expenses were $4.6 billion, down 4% year-on-year. Fiscal 2023 operating income was $22.1 billion, up 9% year-over-year and represented 62% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $23.2 billion, up 10% year-over-year and represented 65% of net revenue. This figure excludes $502 million of depreciation. We spent $452 million on capital expenditures, and free cash flow grew 8% year-on-year to $17.6 billion or 49% of fiscal 2023 revenue. Now turning to capital allocation. For fiscal 2023

Operator, please open up the call for questions.

For fiscal 2023, consolidated revenue hit a record $35.8 billion, growing 8% year-on-year. And since 2020, even though we have not made an acquisition, we have shown a robust trajectory of growth driven by semiconductor growing at an 18% CAGR over the past three years. In fiscal 2023, operating profit grew by 9% year-on-year, and our free cash flow grew 8% year-on-year to $17.6 billion or 49% of revenue. We returned $13.5 billion in cash to our shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. As you well know, we just closed the acquisition of VMware on November 22, just about four weeks into Broadcom's fiscal 2024. We are now refocusing VMware on its core business of creating private

The engagement with our North American customers continues to be deep, strategic and multiyear. And accordingly, in fiscal '24, we expect wireless revenue to again remain stable year-on-year. Next, our Q4 server storage connected -- connectivity revenue was $1 billion or 14% of semiconductor revenue and down 17% year-on-year. In fiscal '23, server storage connectivity was $4.5 billion, up 11% year-on-year. And going to fiscal '24, we expect server storage revenue to decline mid- to high teens percentage year-on-year, driven by the cyclical weakness that began late '23. And moving on to broadband, Q4 revenue declined 9% year-on-year to $950 million, in line with expectations and represented 13% of semiconductor
